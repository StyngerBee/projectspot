# The Last Power Outage ~ Project 2

   ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green) 

   ## Description
   Our motivation for creating this project was to showcase our programming skills learned throughout modules 1-14, also to showcase a collabrative build of a real-world application. Building this project helped us understand ```Node.js, Express.js, REStful.api's, Handlebars, MySql and Sequalize ORM``` skills on another level and helped us learn how to apply it to real world problems by creating an application that allows users to showcase their own projects and any funding required for the project startup and a place to donate them.
